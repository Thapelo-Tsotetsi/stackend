The code uses symfony framework to provide information to the South Africa community as a whole. The information include but not limited to bursaries, vacation works, graduate programme, inservice training and scholarships

The website link will be availabel here as soon as the project goes live: www.stackend.com

The aim is to bring unified information across south africa youth. Infomation on the site will not require anything beyond two years of working experience.
By allowing everyone to share job opportunities that they have a knowledge off and that is related to them, we can better refine and search
for opportunities easily.
