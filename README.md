The code uses symfony framework to provide information to the South Africa community as a whole. The information include but not limited to bursaries, vacation works, graduate programme, inservice training and scholarships

The website link will be availabel here as soon as the project goes live: www.stackend.com

The aim is to bring or aggrigate information across available on the internet and by word of month. Infomation on the site will not require a candidate to have beyond two years of working experience.
By allowing everyone to share job opportunities that they have a knowledge off and that is related to them, we can better refine and search
for opportunities easily.
